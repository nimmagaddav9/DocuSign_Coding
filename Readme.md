1.  Tell us about your React experience (lifecycles, hooks, reusable components)
 
React Component Lifecycle
    I have extensive experience working with React's component lifecycle methods:
    Mounting: When a component is being inserted into the DOM.
    Updating: When a component's state or props change.
    Unmouting: when a component is being removed from the DOM.
 
  React Hooks
    I'm well-versed in using React Hooks to add state and lifecycle features to functional components:
    useState: Manages state in functional components.
    useEffect: Manages side effects in functional components.
    useContext: Consumes context in functional components.
    useReducer: Manage state with a reducer function, For More complex state management.
    useRef: Accesses DOM elements or stores mutable values.
    useCallback: performance improvement usecase
    useMemo: performance improvement usecase.
    
Creating Reusable Components
    React Simplifies the creation of SPA by using reusable components.
    React enables the creation of reusable components that can be composed together, fostering a modular and efficient development process.
 
Overall, my experience spans the full React component lifecycle, modern hooks-based development, and creating scalable component architectures. 
I'm passionate about writing clean, efficient, and reusable React code.
	 
	2. How would you rate your expertise with React?
I would rate my expertise with React as advanced. I've been working extensively with React for over 5+ years now.
 
	3. Explain your experience with design systems and design patterns?

Design Systems Experience
Design systems are crucial for maintaining consistency and efficiency in front-end development. I have experience working with and contributing to design systems in the following ways:
· Collaborated with designers and developers to create and maintain a comprehensive design system that included reusable UI components, style guides, and documentation.
· Utilized tools like Storybook to showcase and document components, making it easier for team members to understand and use the design system.
 
Design Patterns Implementation
Design patterns are essential for solving common problems in software design. In my front-end work, I've applied several design patterns, including:
 
Component-Based Architecture: React structures user interfaces as modular, reusable components, promoting a more maintainable and scalable approach to building applications.
 
Container/Presentational Pattern: Separating logic and presentation concerns to enhance component reusability and testability.
 
Render Props and Higher-Order Components: Render props are a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.
This function returns a React element and is used by the component to render part of its output.
 
Flux/Redux Pattern: Implementing unidirectional data flow for state management in complex applications.
 
	4. Do you have any experience making React accessible?
I worked in different organizations to ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility guidelines like WCAG.
Also, tools like NVDA can be used to test and improve accessibility.
 
	5. What is your experience with package management?
The two most common package managers used with React projects are:
npm stands for Node Package Manager and is used to manage dependencies for your React project, including the React Library itself.
Yarn: An alternative to npm developed by Facebook. Yarn tool is used to download the libraries in a faster manner in React.
	 
 
	6. Testing experience and do you have experience with Jest and PlayWright?
I have significant hands-on experience using Jest for JavaScript testing. Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework often used with React. 
It is commonly used with React because it provides a simple and powerful testing solution with features like snapshot testing, coverage reporting, and built-in assertions.
 
	7. Overall experience with CSS and APIs?
CSS and APIs is used to create polished, responsive front-end interfaces that efficiently communicate with back-end services, resulting in performant and user-friendly web applications.
